% ott.tmatrix.dda -- A minimal DDA implementation for T-matrix calculation.
%
% This directory contains a minimal DDA implementation that was originally
% intended for OTTv2 but has been moved into 1.6 for ott.tmatrix.dda.
% This will move in a future release of OTT when more support is added
% for force calculation using methods other than the T-matrix method.
%
% Classes
%   Dda         - Discrete dipole approximation implementation
%   DdaHighMem  - DDA implement at which may be faster but uses more memory
%   Dipole      - Dipole beam/field calculation methods
%
% Sub-packages
%   +polarizability   - Functions to calculate polarizabilities
