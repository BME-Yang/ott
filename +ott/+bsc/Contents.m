% ott.bsc -- Classes representing the beam shape coefficients.
%
% These classes encapsulate the beam shape coefficient a/b vectors and
% provide methods for manipulating them (such as translations/rotations).
%
% Classes
%   Bsc         -- Base class for all Bsc functionality
%   LgParaxial  -- Point matching with a reduced LG basis in paraxial limit
%   PlaneWave   -- Specialisation for plane wave Bsc (nicer translations)
%   Annular     -- Specialisation for annular Bsc (nicer translations)
