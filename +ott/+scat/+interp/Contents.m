% ott.scat.interp Interpolation based force/scattering methods
%
% This package contains methods that interpolate scattering and/or
% force data.  The methods require a data set, either from an experiment
% or simulated using one of the other scattering methods.
%
% These methods offer a significant improvement in accuracy compared to
% the harmonic method while being significantly faster than methods such as
% the T-matrix method.
