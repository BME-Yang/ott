% ott.scat Methods to calculate optical scattering
%
% This package contains various methods for calculating optical scattering
% and the resulting forces on particle in optical beams.
%
% The package is split into various sub-packages based on the method
% or approximation used for the scattering calculation.
%
% Sub-packages
%   +tmatrix        - T-matrix method (based on OTT version 1)
%   +geometric      - Geometric optics (based on OTGO)
%   +dipole         - Dipole approximation
%   +shapeforce     - Shape-induced force field method
%   +harmonic       - Harmonic approximation
%   +interp         - Interpolation based methods
