% ott.scat Methods to calculate optical scattering
%
% This package contains various methods for calculating optical scattering
% and the resulting forces on particle in optical beams.
%
% The package is split into various sub-packages based on the method
% or approximation used for the scattering calculation.
%
% Scattering method packages
%   +vswf           - Vector spherical wave function basis (based on OTT v1)
%   +planewave      - Plane wave basis scattering
%   +geometric      - Geometric optics (based on OTGO)
%   +dipole         - Dipole approximation
%   +shapeforce     - Shape-induced force field method
%   +interp         - Interpolation methods (include harmonic approximation)
%
% Classes
%   Particle        - Base class for particle based scattering method
%
% Other packages
%   +utils          - Classes to assist in implementing scattering method
