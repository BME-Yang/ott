% ott/examples Example files for the optical tweezers toolbox (OTT)
%
% This directory and sub-directories contain examples for the optical
% tweezers toolbox.  These examples are intended to demonstrate the
% main features of the toolbox.
%
% Examples in this directory are split into 'basic' and 'advanced'.
% The basic examples provide a description of several main features of
% the toolbox and are almost verbatim with the examples included in the
% documentation.  The advanced examples provided significantly less
% describing text/detail and focus on more advanced features of the toolbox.
% For further details, see the user manual.
%
% If OTT is installed as a Matlab Add-on, these examples can be opened
% using, for example, ``open examples/ottBeams.m`` directly from the
% command window.  Alternatively, navigate to the examples directory and
% open the desired example using the file browser.
%
