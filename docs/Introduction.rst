Introduction
############

The optical tweezers toolbox (OTT) includes a collection of methods
for simulating particles held in optical traps including methods for
force calculation, simulating tightly focused beams and simulating
particle dynamics.
The toolbox is implemented as a Matlab package, consisting of several
sub-packages collecting related methods together.
The original version of the toolbox focussed on force calculation using
the T-matrix method; this version extends the original toolbox to
include several methods for calculating forces and torques as well as
methods for simulating dynamics in several common configurations.
This documentation describes the toolbox and is split into four main
chapters:

   * :ref:`getting-started` contains information for setting up
     the toolbox and running the examples along with a more detailed
     overview of the toolbox structure and unit conventions.

   * :ref:`examples` describes some of the toolbox functionality in
     more details including examples of the most commonly performed
     tasks with the toolbox.

   * :ref:`reference` provides a more detailed description of each
     package/class/function with usage, examples and discussion of
     parameters.  This section is mostly generated from the source
     code documentation which can be accessed by typing
     ``help ott`` in the Matlab console.

Additional information on more specific topics can be found on the
`GitHub page <https://github.com/ilent2/ott>`__ or in the
:ref:`conceptual-notes` and :ref:`further-reading` sections.

Contributing
============

If you would like to contribute a feature, report a bug or request we
add something to the toolbox, the easiest way is by `creating a new
issue on the OTT GitHub page <https://github.com/ilent2/ott/issues>`__.

If you have code you would like to submit, fork the repository, add the
code and open a new issue. This method is preferable to pasting the code
in the issue or sending it to us via email since your contribution
details will remain attached to the commit you send (tracking
authorship).
